# GoodArchive

GoodArchive is a public documentation platform for preserving and organizing examples of extremist, violent, and anti-social rhetoric that appear in open online spaces.

The goal is not to shame, harass, or incite retaliation —  
The goal is to **document reality**.

History is shaped by what people choose to remember.  
This project exists so future generations can see what was said, who said it, and how it was normalized.

## Mission

GoodArchive exists to:

• Preserve public evidence of harmful rhetoric  
• Create an accessible historical record  
• Enable research, analysis, and accountability  
• Prevent collective amnesia  
• Expose patterns, not individuals for harassment  

This is a **documentation project**, not an activist campaign.

---

## What This Is Not

GoodArchive does **not**:

• Encourage harassment  
• Promote doxxing  
• Coordinate retaliation  
• Contact employers or families  
• Organize brigades or campaigns  
• Interfere in private lives  

All submissions must be **publicly available content**.

What third parties choose to do with publicly visible information is outside the scope of this project.

## Why This Matters

Extremism thrives when memory fades.

Public rhetoric becomes normalized when it goes unrecorded.  
Violence becomes minimized when its roots are ignored.  
History becomes distorted when evidence disappears.

GoodArchive exists to preserve **what was said**, **where it was said**, and **how often it was said**.

Documentation is not cruelty.  
Silence is.

## How the Platform Works

• Anyone can submit publicly available material  
• Submissions are reviewed before being published  
• Approved entries appear in the public feed and search  
• Moderators control visibility  
• Sensitive metadata is isolated and protected  

The platform prioritizes:

• Accuracy  
• Context  
• Public sourcing  
• Security  
• Non-interference  

---

## Legal & Ethical Scope

All content must be:

• Public  
• Lawfully accessible  
• Non-private  
• Non-hacked  
• Non-leaked  

No private data.  
No unlawful material.  
No coercion.

This project documents speech — it does not participate in it.

## Contributing

If you believe:

• Documentation matters  
• Memory matters  
• Accountability matters  
• History should be preserved  

Then you are welcome to contribute.

This project is open source by design.

## Final Note

GoodArchive is not about moral superiority.

It is about **record keeping**.

History is written by those who save the receipts.
